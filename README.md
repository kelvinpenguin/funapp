- **Refresh data**: Pull down to refresh or use the refresh button

## Features in Detail

### Real-time Tracking
- Aircraft positions update every 30 seconds
- Automatic map region adjustment
- Live status indicators (airborne/ground)
- Color-coded altitude visualization

### Search and Filtering
- Search by flight callsign, ICAO24, or country
- Filter by altitude range
- Show only airborne or grounded aircraft
- Country-specific filtering

### Data Visualization
- Interactive maps with aircraft markers
- Statistical breakdown by country
- Real-time flight counts
- Historical data preservation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **No flights showing**: Check internet connection and try refreshing
2. **Map not loading**: Ensure location services are enabled
3. **Search not working**: Clear search text and try again
4. **API errors**: Verify API keys in settings

### Data Accuracy
- Flight data is sourced from ADS-B transponders
- Position accuracy depends on aircraft equipment
- Some military or private aircraft may not appear
- Data updates may have slight delays

## Technical Requirements
